# esprobot
Wifi controlled legged robot, using 2-axis analogic actuators

THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS PROJECT

Based on the microcontroller ESP8266-03, the idea is to build a robot platform supporting up to 8 channels, to test and improve my 2-axis analogic actuators, based on fishing-line muscles.

To compile this, the Espressif SDK 1.5.4 is needed. The easiest way to get it working is by using ESP-OPEN-SDK (it can be found at: https://github.com/pfalcon/esp-open-sdk.git )
