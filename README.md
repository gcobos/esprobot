Wifi controlled legged robot, using 2-axis analogic actuators

THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS PROJECT

Based on the microcontroller ESP8266-03, the idea is to build a robot platform supporting up to 8 channels, to test and improve my 2-axis analogic actuators, based on fishing-line muscles.

The easiest way to get this project running is by getting: http://platformio.org/ and executing: 

platformio run --target upload
